	<p>Due to some <a href="https://github.com/ccpgames/esi-issues/issues/198">wonky bullshit</a> from CCP not updating their CORS requests, I can't get your character ID from the access token I'm given when you log in. If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it. Just give me the ID manually.</p>
	<div class="form-group row">
		<label for="characterId"

			Character ID
